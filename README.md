# To-Do List App
Simple ToDo list app

#How to Use
To use the app, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. You should see a form where you can enter a task and add it to the list by clicking the "Add Task" button. The task will appear in the list with a checkbox next to it. You can mark a task as complete by clicking the checkbox, and you can delete a task by clicking the "X" button next to it.

#Development

If you want to modify or improve the app, you can edit the source code in the index.html file. The JavaScript code is included in a <script> element at the bottom of the file, and the CSS styles are included in a `<index.css>` element in the <head> section. Feel free to experiment with different styles or features to make the app your own.
